Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are \"fixed\" and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.</p>\\n\\n<p>You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It\\'s all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.</p>\\n\\n<p>In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving.</p>\\n']"

       "12821  im working on a classification problem i want to classify iris flowers from the famous iris data set using mlp i know that i the number of neurons in output layer should be the same number of classes but can i use one neuron in output layer which output is the value  or  or  to refer to the three types or then it is considered as regression not classification  thanks  trin

       "4490   i am running an svr prediction on some time series data and i am receiving this weird offset between my actual and predicted values  i found this  svm regression  lag post that mentions adding a lag of  data points behind instead of one  however i am not sure how to incorporate that into my code which ive included below  does anyone have any ideas on why my predicted vs actual is offset in this manner    my code is as follows   usrbinpythonimport mathimport statisticsimport visualizerimport numpy as npfrom datagen import constructdatafrom sklearn import svm applies support

       "5807   i am relatively new to using wordvec i am interested in solving the topicword intrusion introduced  here  by using the vector spaces of words generated by wordvec and svc   i have a corpus with a vocabulary of  words the vocabulary is perfectly contained in the googles wordvec trained model i was wondering which model would provide a better representation of the words the pretrained model on m words or a model trained only on the  words appearing in my corpus  thanks

       "6022   i am new to the field of machine learning and recently learned the basics and working out various algorithms in python using libraries such as pandas numpy matplotlib scikitlearn  etc                     i started learning about working bigdata by distributing it and using apache sparks library mllib to load and apply algorithms on it so is working with mllib the only way on spark or is there any other way to use pandas and other libraries on distributed data

       "7127   im trying to see how well a decision tree classifier performs on my input for this im trying to use the  validation and learning curves  and sklearns  crossvalidation methods  however they differ and i dont know what to make of it  the validation curve shows up as follows  based on varying the maximum depth parameter im getting worse and worse crossval scores however when i try the  crossvalscore  i get  accuracy reliably   while i was using the default tree depth for  clf  here it still puzzles me how the validation curve never reaches even  but the crossval scores are all above  what does this mean why is there a discrepancy   code for reference below  for the validation curve  import matplotlibpyplot as pltimport numpy as npfrom sklearndatasets import loaddigitsfrom

       "7852   im writing a university report on for the toxici comment classification kaggle competition comparing different attempt made with different models and  i want to know if convolutional neural networks are one model multiple output layers model   onmo are also known as multitask learning this approach would have one input layer one set of hidden layers and one output layer for each label  on the other hand cnn are several layers of convolutions with nonlinear activation functions like relu or tanh applied to the results it uses convolutions over the input layer to compute the output rather than a fully connected layer or affine layer

       "7079   i understand how to build and train a neural network like shown below as well as those lowlevel featuresfilters i wonder what are those  highlevel features  how exactly do you obtain them from a trained neural network are those like the  eigenfaces    note the image is by nvidia and i dont know the specifics of the classification problem here if needed suppose the network is trained to distinguish human from cat

       "13485  given a time series  ft  to forecast let us consider an arma model of the form ft  c  sumip ai fti  et  sumjq bj etj  where  et  are the forecast errors  on the train set if  ft  is the ground truth then we define its estimate obtained with this model as  widetildeft  ft  et   let  m  minpq  we can rewrite the first equation as widetildeft  c  sumim ai  bi fti  sumimp ai fti  sumjq bj widetildeftj then after reparametrization can be rewritten as widetildeft  c  sumik ci fti  sumjq bj widetildeftj which is the equation of a layer recurrent neural network rnn without activation function  so are arma models a subset of rnns or is there a flaw in this reasoning

       "10513  i am a noob in the field of ml i have been trying to classify the iris dataset i managed to do it with backpropagation and with  neurons in the hidden layer but the mean square error

       "4968   you have set of input nodes hidden nodes and output nodes although i have one output node in my case  we assign weights to the connections between those nodes so is there any pattern of assigning weights to those connections   this is one pattern of assigning weights to neural network see the another way of assigning the weights   please tell which one of the following is the correct way of assigning the weights to the neural network

       "11744  the problem im trying to solve is the following  the data is movielens with nusers and nmovies  million ratings  for each user a vector of size nmovies is defined and the values of the vector are  if the user rated the movie before time t  if not for instance if the user rated movie  and  the input vector is   the goal is to predict the movie the user will rate in the future between time t and tdelta t the labels are vector of size nmovies and if the user rate the movie  the labels vector is   im currently trying to get some initial results based on fully connected layers but it seems that it cannot optimize the loss at all the representation might be too sparse but it seems that the neural network should be able to learn at least some features  is it possible to make this

       "520    im currently going into the world of machine learning and neural networks thanks to  synaptic js  that interests me a lot  so i read a lot wikipedia links and  synaptics nn   but theres a lot of basics questions that i dont understand but id like to in the use of machine learning nn and the point of these technologies  lets say i want my network to kind of learn something like gravity so to train it i set in input  objects with a mass and a position x y and z and i set output the new x y and z of each objectsi guess i should give it several configurations and everything but  here is the question can it then be able to compute the interactions between   objects  at this stage in my learning what i dont clearly get is what is the point of teachingtraining neurons to compute xor like its shown in  synaptics documentation   var trainingset              input         output                 input         output                 input         output                 input         output     var trainer  new trainermynetworktrainertraintrainingset  were we just give it all the possible inputs and outputs to a xor  well as im all new to the technologies i think my questions are full of nonsense and everything but thanks for reading and help you might bring

       "13114  ive been training an implementation of mask rcnn and it was training very successfully on my cpu but ive just set up my gpu and it is giving some strange results when looking at my validation loss it is as if the learning rate got turned up when i moved to using my gpu has anyone ever experienced this or know what could cause this difference i didnt think there was any

       "11892  i have a dataset of text documents splitted into train and test sets my task is a binary classification classifying these documents to either  or  i have already computed some features using tfidf and ngrams and tested my model now i want to add some other features using topic models lda and lsa to see if it can improve the fscore and performance of my model  my question is fairly simply should i create my topic models only using my train set or since topic models are not created based on a label target or dependent variable would it be correct if i use both train and test sets to create the topic model

       "4877   i am totally new to artificial neural networks lets say that the model you are trying to turn into an artificial neural network has an output that is triggered  only  by the exceedance of a threshold ygeq y therefore you need to find a way to use this inequality as an activation function is this feasible

       "11705  i am trying to cluster data using  scikits expectationmaximization  so i created two different data sets from a normal distribution which is i have shown in the graph below   the mean for each of the distribution is  mean of distr mean of distr   but after i run the em using scikit i get the mean as follows  mean after em       how am i supposed to interpret this mean i am trying to create two clusters from the data here is my code  import numpy as npimport matplotlibpyplot as pltfrom sklearnmixture import gaussianmixturedistr  npsin  nprandomrandn  nprandomrandndistr

       "11874  i am very new to neural networks and machine learning and i have been making a bitcoin price predictor to learn it i was wondering about the number of hidden layers id need in a recurrent neural net using lstm cells   i have  inputs for  previous days close prices in hour intervals and require  output for the future  hours   i am doing this with keras in python any help would

       "12617  i have a dataset like this where the first column is the age of usage of product of a user in days and second column is the response of the user to the typical nps survey question   using these responses of all users we calculate nps which is outlined here  httpswwwnetpromotercomknow  i want to find some relationimpact of this age of the product usage on nps   it can be some visualization or some model which helps me figure that out   my concern is if i do some regression of actual response with this age variable its not the relation between age and nps which is one single metric from all responses   so am not sure how to solve this problem or find the relation of age with nps overall   any help would be really appreciated   array

       "529    is the knearest neighbour algorithm a discriminative or a generative classifier my first thought on this was that it was generative because it actually used bayess theorem to compute the posterior searching further for this it seems like it is a discriminative model but i couldnt find the explanation  so is knn discriminative first of all and if it is is that because it doesnt model the the priors or the likelihood

       "13251  i came across conditional gan where the classes can be provided as input to the gan i would like to know if the same network can be used for classes which can take any continuous valueie the generator once trained should be able to produce output for any condition even if it was not a part of training set

       "11737  so it is a well known thing that it is a good idea to scale featurestraining samples in the training set so that the values do not differ too much in the absolute sense for example we want to train a neural network to learn a simple quadratic function y  xx  the training data say looks like x        for input data and y        for target data  obviously one would scale both the input and the output data by something like x  x and y  y so all the training values live in the  range  my question is what if i then want to predict the output value for the input if i feed    into the network and then rescale the output by doing output  output   i will not get the correct result how to resolve such an issue

       "2361   i have a test dataset and train dataset as below i have provided sample data with min records but my data has more than s of record here if you see  e  is my target variable which i need to predict using an algorithm it has only four categories like     it can take only any of these values  training dataset  a    b    c    d    e                                                                                                        test dataset  a    b    c    d    e                                                       since  e  has only  categories i thought of predicting this using multinomial logistic regression  vs rest logic i am trying to implement it using python   i know the logic that we need to set these targets in a variable and use an algorithm to predict any of these values  output    but i am stuck at a point on how to use it using python sklearn to loop through these values and what algorithm should i use to predict the output values any help would be greatly appreciated

       "13018  i have a data set of total  sound samples these are the results of my multi layer neural network binary classifier  precision  recall  fscore  s  accuracy training accuracy test   i am happy with the test accuracy precision and recall but the  accuracy bugs me since its overfitting to the trainingset is this a bad thing even the testset accuracy is satisfactory  here below i load the car sound features and other types of sounds features from disk and assign the labels i double checked and i dont add labels as a feature while i process and extract features from audio sets are

       "9788   let say i have a feature that may have one of  values  i want to provide it as a nn input what is proper way to do that  i can map it like                 or something similar to have mean of  and std near  but in this example  is much different than  compared to difference of  and  and i dont want such discrimination cos  and  are equally different to me as  and   another way is to have  features where each of them relates to a class  and has value of  if initial feature has value that matches it and has value of  if it doesnt match it   like this            but i dont like here the fact that this feature gets to much weight especially if it has many classes  i was thinking to make separated layer just for this feature do you have some better solution

       "3316   i am try to recreate karpathys great tutorial on  rnn characterlevel text generation  using tensorflow  promise to contribute the code back to the community once it works meanwhile my code runs but the model does not converge it stays stuck on the same level of error and emits rubbish i suspect that the code is correct but my hyperparameters are off  if someone previously trained a textgenerating rnn successfully i would be glad to get some hints on the parameters below the input i use currently is nltk bible corpus about mb of text but i can use something else    number of steps ie sequence length  batch size  number of hidden units  number of layers  optimizer and optimization parameters  im using adagrad with decaying learning rate trying to mimick the original script but it is not a must  any other tricks for the network architecture or optimization  most important the number of epochs full scans of the data needed before the model start emitting something

       "12061  my weights are store in a two dimensional matrix row i refers to node i in preceding layer and columns in that row are the neurons node i is connected to i only want to keep some nodes how do i pick  max weights and store it in a separate array while keeping track of which neuron it belonged to moreover is it tested in theory that some weights contribute more than the others
